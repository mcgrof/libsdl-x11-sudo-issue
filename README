About
=====

Some virtualization systems like to prefer SDL as the
default option for spawning instances for viewing the
guests as they boot up. This is xen's default. There is
an issue with SDL and using sudo to create new guests
though and this example program demonstrates the issue.

The purpose of this simple program is to demonstrate and
test the issue of using sudo and SDL and look for the best
more reasonable solution. A respective bug report was opened
on libsdl.org:

https://bugzilla.libsdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2446

Hope is that evolution of this sample code can be used to
address this issue in other programs that run into the same
corner case issue.

Build
=====

make

Usage
=====

As a regular user you see no issues (note: this will full screen,
and its not easy to recover):

	./sdl1
	./sdl2

You can trigger the same observed issue as seen on xen when creating
a guest with 'xl create /etc/xen/foo.hvm' by running this program as
root as well:

	sudo ./sdl2
	sudo ./sdl2

This will fail on Linux with:

Error while initializing SDL:  No available video device

To account for this upstream qemu/ui/sdl.c sets the default video
driver to x11 with:

setenv("SDL_VIDEODRIVER", "x11", 0);

It then make this note:

/* on Linux, SDL may use fbcon|directfb|svgalib when run without            
 * accessible $DISPLAY to open X11 window.  This is often the case          
 * when qemu is run using sudo.  But in this case, and when actually        
 * run in X11 environment, SDL fights with X11 for the video card,          
 * making current display unavailable, often until reboot.                  
 * So make x11 the default SDL video driver if this variable is unset.      
 * This is a bit hackish but saves us from bigger problem.                  
 * Maybe it's a good idea to fix this in SDL instead.
